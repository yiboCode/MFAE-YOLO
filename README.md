# MFAE-YOLO
The content is keep updating.
## A Quick Overview 

## Start
Firstly, you should prepare the dataset for training or testing. 
Follow the next steps for training or testing.
1. Prepare the datasets as instructed in the [Dataset Preparing](#dataset_section).
2. If you want test or use our pretrained MFAE-YOLO, please download and prepare the .pt files as instructed in the [Pretrained Weights](#weights_section).
3. Now, you can run the train.py file to start training.

## Dataset Preparing <a id="dataset_section"></a>
You can download our preproccessed dataset from the follow link:

## Pretrained Weights <a id="weights_section"></a>
There are three .pt files when you download. which are pretrained on  three datasets: NWPU VHR-10, RSOD, and DIOR. Please put the .pt files in the "models/" dirtory.

## Requirement
We have exported our virtual environment configuration in conda, You can use our configuration file, freeze.yml, to quickly deploy the runtime environment.
